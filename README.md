# WebViewer - Vue sample

[WebViewer](https://docs.apryse.com/documentation/web/) is a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that is part of the [Apryse PDF SDK](https://apryse.com). It provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that interacts with the core library to view, annotate and manipulate PDFs that can be embedded into any web project.

This repo is specifically designed for any users interested in integrating WebViewer into Vue project. You can [read a guide](https://docs.apryse.com/documentation/web/get-started/vue/). This project has been scaffolded using [vite](https://vitejs.dev) through the `create-vue` npm command as recommended by the developers of Vue.js. For more details, see [here](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/tooling.html)
